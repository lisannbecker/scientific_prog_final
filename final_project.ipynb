    "The problem: As a student at UvA, I am aware that I can register for courses outside of my own programme. If I want to expand beyond my field, I could, for example enroll for a course that is taught as part of the Communication Science Bachelor's. However, not all courses are open for such guest students, and it is hard to find out which courses one is actually elegible to sign up for. This undermines that people develop new and interdisciplinary interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "What exists already: Currently, potential guest students visit the UvA's course catalouge (studiegids). The course cataglogue offers some non-individualised filter options, including the field of study or the academic year the student is in. However, there mare more fine-grained entry requirements. To review these, students have to click through potentially thousands of courses and read through a text box to see if they are elegible. From my experience, this threshold is too high - especially students who are open to taking guest courses in various fields will not be motivated to check their options. Many students default to enrolling for guest courses they have hear of through word by mouth or stop considering guest courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "My project: I gathered data from the course catalouge and built a programme that goes beyond the filtering options of the UvA course catalouge. Next to the existing fillters, personal eligibility is checked. My program works with a list of courses the student has completed and checks these against the entry requirements that I have extracted from the full-text of the course catalouge. Instead of specifying the filters, e.g., study field of interest, in the command shell, I built a GUI where users can enter their preferences and view their options. For myself, using no filters, the courses that I am elegible for were only 27% of the total courses offered. The remaining 73% are noise that I could not have filtered out because it is based on my personal eligibility."
